I gave a presentation to the Virginia Cyber Security Partnership in 2017 regarding Cloud Security! My talk focused on creating a new defense in depth model for public cloud environments, while showing practical examples of how to implement the technology of the new model.

You can see the YouTube video below, which is a recording of that presentation.
