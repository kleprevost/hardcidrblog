      <description>Note: Bonobos has been contacted about this issue and has been taken care of. All of the codes are dead now anyway :P
Every year for the past couple of years the online retailer Bonobos.com has held an &amp;ldquo;Easter Egg Hunt&amp;rdquo; on their website. This is typically a fun event whereby you check various pages on their website for codes used to unlock store credit, discounts, and other goodies. The main prize this year was a $500 voucher off any order, but you had to be the first to find and use the code.</description>

      <description>I gave a presentation to the Virginia Cyber Security Partnership in 2017 regarding Cloud Security! My talk focused on creating a new defense in depth model for public cloud environments, while showing practical examples of how to implement the technology of the new model.
You can see the YouTube video below, which is a recording of that presentation.
