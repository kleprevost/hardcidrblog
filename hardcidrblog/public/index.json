	"content": " I\u0026rsquo;m a big advocate of science-backed supplements to optimize mental and physical performance. These articles represent my own distilled research on effectiveness, risk, and other things to consider before supplementing. To see what supplements I am currently taking, definitely check out the \u0026ldquo;My Current Supplements\u0026rdquo; article at the top of this section. Most of the sources are dervived from Examine.com, which is a great resource, but my intent is to distill it down and add my own research + anecdotes.\nWhat is Magnesium? Magnesium is an essential dietary mineral that is critical to numerous functions within the human body. The human body is so reliant on magnesium that it stores more than 25g of the mineral across different systems at any given time - with most of this mineral storage occurring in soft tissues.1 More than 50% of the United States is deficient in magnesium because it is relatively difficult to obtain proper amounts of magnesium through diet alone. Older populations are more prone to magnesium deficiency, but supplementation is recommended for anyone who does not eat a ton of nuts or dark leafy greens.\nMagnesium Sources Two places:\n Diet - Spinach, various types of nuts, brown rice, and avocados all magnesium rich. However, it is difficult to meet the RDA (300-400mg) for magnesium through diet alone. Supplements  A report by the US Nutritional Health and Examination Survey in 2006 (Research: 1) found that 60% of Americans are magnesium deficient.2 This is second only to Vitamin D deficiency.\nBenefits of Supplementing Magnesium Benefits are listed from best supported to least supported\n Protects Against Diabetes - Magnesium makes the pancreas more efficient, which results in lowered blood glucose and increased insulin sensitivity in magnesium deficient non-diabetics.3 Lowers Blood Pressure - correcting a magnesium deficiency resulted in a blood pressure drop of 7.1% (systolic) and 4.7% (diastolic) in healthy subjects.4 Improves Sleep Quality - Magnesium supplementation increased time spent in slow-wave sleep, which is linked to improvements in overall memory. Also reduced sleeping cortisol levels.5 Might Help With ADHD - Strong correlation was found between ADHD and magnesium deficiency in children. No conclusive evidence has been found regarding a causal relationship.6 Might Help With Depression - Weaker correlation here between depression and magnesium deficiency. The neat thing is that magnesium may be synergistic with SSRIs, which would improve depression treatments. (Research:4) Might Increase Aerobic Exercise Capacity - One study showed a marked improvement in cardio performance in trained athletes supplementing with magnesium.[^14]  Downsides and Toxicity to Magnesium Supplementation Magnesium Oxide (the form you don\u0026rsquo;t want to buy) causes laxative effects when taken orally. It is recommended below to take a non-laxative and higher bioavailable form of magnesium.\nIt is almost impossible to reach the toxicity level for magnesium, as the kidneys are very efficient at filtering out excess quantities. There are extremely rare cases of magnesium toxicity, but only because the patients kidneys failed. The worst thing that will happen if you take too much will be laxative effects, which is more embarrassing than life threatening.1\nDosages and Timing For Magnesium Magnesium supplements are a little more complicated than one would think. Magnesium is not easily absorbed by the body on its own, so manufacturers often attach it to a transporting substance so that it can be absorbed. This results in many variants of magnesium supplements that all have differing effectiveness. There are two factors that you should watch out for: elemental magnesium and bioavailability. Elemental magnesium is the actual content of magnesium in the supplement - often this is printed on the bottle. Bioavailability, on the other hand, relates to the effectiveness of the transporting substance. High elemental magnesium and high bioavailability is the goal, since taking tons of huge pills sucks.\nList sorted from most recommended to least\n Magnesium Glycinate - Most recommended. Has a high bioavailability (80%), but low elemental magnesium by weight, so you will be taking a couple large pills daily. The \u0026ldquo;Glycinate\u0026rdquo; part helps with sleep, so best taken before bed.7 Magnesium Taurinate - Also has a great bioavailability and is very similar to Magnesium Glycinate. The taurine molecule bound to the elemental magnesium makes it a great candidate to take before bed, since taurine can be used to enhance sleep quality.7 Magnesium-L-Threonate - Upregulates NMDA receptors and increases brain BDNF levels, which boosts active memory and learning. Only rat studies available, but the nootropics community seems to like it.8 Magnesium-L-Orotate - Shown to increase physical performance in triathletes and similar extreme athletes. Not much research on this yet.9 Magnesium Oxide - Cheapest, most common option. Magnesium Oxide is the most common form of magnesium supplementation, but has very poor absorption rates (4-5%) and can cause gastro-intestinal distress. You need to take a lot of this to get any of the above benefits.7  Magnesium Glycinate or Taurinate are the most recommended. The optimal time to take these supplements is before bed due to the glycine/taurine acting as sleep-enhancing agents.\nDosing for magnesium is a piece of cake. Just shoot for the recommended daily intake of 300-400mg of elemental magnesium.7 See the \u0026ldquo;When and how to take\u0026rdquo; section regarding exactly what this means - picking out the right form of magnesium gets tricky depending on what you are going for.\nConclusion and Recommendations Magnesium is another major dietary deficiency that can be easily fixed with little cost. The upsides are pretty big in the long run, and honestly the better sleep quality is nice day to day. Overall, highly recommended for daily use.\nRecommended Brand: Doctors Best Magnesium Glycinate or Nootropics Depot Magnesium Glycinate. They both rank well in terms of purity and quality.\nThe cost of magnesium supplementation is right around $0.12 - $0.16 per day. That is cheap enough to justify adding to any supplement stack.\nResearch / Sources  NIH Fact Sheet on Magnesium [return] NHANES What we eat in America: NHANES 2005-2006 [return] Magnesium improves the beta-cell function to compensate variation of insulin sensitivity: double-blind, randomized clinical trial.

These articles represent my own distilled research on effectiveness, risk, and other things to consider before supplementing. To see what supplements I am currently taking, definitely check out the \u0026ldquo;My Current Supplements\u0026rdquo; article at the top of this section. Most of the sources are dervived from Examine.com, which is a great resource, but my intent is to distill it down and add my own research + anecdotes.\nQuick Summary Taurine is an amino acid the body makes on its own, but supplementation is extremely safe and has multiple benefits. Taurine is great at: reducing anxiety, improving sleep, improving cardiac health (cholesterol/hypertension), and being an antioxidant.\nWhat is Taurine? Taurine is an acid that contains an amino group, which technically makes it an \u0026ldquo;amino acid\u0026rdquo;, however biologically speaking is not considered an amino acid per the proper definition. Taurine is created naturally by the body in the liver, but used by almost every cell in the human body. It is considered one of the most abundant amino acids in the body - particularly in the brain and muscle tissue.1 Taurine deficiency is relatively rare and caused primarily by various diseases2, however supplementation does have benefits.\nTaurine crosses the blood brain barrier, however there are no known taurine receptors in the brain. Instead, taurine plays a modulatory role in the brain - essentially it helps the brain regulate itself. It relieves oxidative stress in the brain, can be used to help recover from head injuries, and most importantly improves sleep quality. I take taurine at night due to the fact that supplementation over 1g results in sleepiness, which is a great side effect in the evening. This effect is speculated to be related to taurine modulating the sensitivity of GABA-A in the brain, which is the primary anti-excitatory neurotransmitter (translation: provides mild anxiety relief).\nTaurine is also a great supplement for weight management and exercise. There have been several studies linking taurine supplementation to better fat regulation (leading to lower body fat overall) as well as increased exercise performance.\nMost people recognize taurine from the ingredients list of many popular energy drinks, which include small amounts of taurine to prevent jitteriness caused by the high amounts of stimulants included in those drinks.\nTaurine Sources  Naturally Occurring: The human body makes almost all of the taurine it needs naturally. Meats: Meats (especially red meat) can contain up to 40-50mg of taurine. This is a pretty small amount, so there isn\u0026rsquo;t much noticeable benefit to increasing meat consumption. Energy Drinks: Monster / Red Bull contain trace amounts of taurine to balance out the stimulant effects. Supplementation: Supplements are sold typically as 1g capsules.  Benefits of Supplementing Taurine  Helps Regulate Blood Glucose/Sugar: There have been several animal studies that have shown that taurine helps regulate blood glucose levels.3 There is one human study that shows this evidence holds up - but the study was restricted to endurance athletes.4 The mechanism by which taurine regulates blood glucose is not understood entirely. Reduces Anxiety: One human study shows that taurine decreases anxiety without impacting memory or muscle function.5 There are dozens of animal studies showing that glycine and GABA-A regulation may be the cause of this mechanism, but has largely confirmed that taurine does have very safe anti-anxiety effects on mammals in general.56 The GABA regulating properties of taurine supplementation have also been shown to reduce seizure frequency.7 Improved Cardiovascular Health: Several studies have shown that taurine supplementation can increase blood flow and reduce oxidative stress on the cardiovascular system.8 There are also studies showing that taurine supplementation can lead to decreased blood cholesterol and lipid counts, although the underlying mechanism is unknown.9 Improved Fat Loss and Potential Increased Exercise Performance: There are several studies showing taurine supplementation increases fat oxidation by 16% during exercise in athletes.10 The research is mixed on whether taurine supplementation increases exercise performance, with some studies finding no difference, while others finding mild improvements in aerobic endurance. One study did find that taurine supplementation did decrease muscle soreness and helped with muscle recovery.11 May Help Protect Hearing and Eyesight: All of these studies are based on mice, so the evidence is not quite as strong for this claim. Taurine supplementation may help protect or reverse against hearing loss (tinnitus specifically).12 It also can prevent degradation of eyesight over time.13  Downsides and Safety to Taurine Supplementation There are no known downsides to taurine supplementation within the known safe dosages.\nThe maximum long-term safe dose of taurine that has been studied is 3,000mg per day.14 This dosage may be lower in people with kidney problems who cannot filter out excess of the compound.\nDosages and Timing For Taurine Most studies on humans evaluate the effectiveness of taurine at dosages between 1,000mg and 2,000mg. I would stick between those two numbers, with 2,000mg per day before bed being the most recommended dosing schedule.\nTaurine is best taken at night before bed because it is slightly sedative. As a result of taurine regulating brain GABA and glycine levels, it can improve sleep considerably when taken before bed.\nConclusion and Recommendations Taurine should be a part of any \u0026ldquo;night time\u0026rdquo; supplement stack. Overall there are little to no downsides to supplementation, due to the fact that it has been extensively studied in animals and humans. The positives are enormous, even if the animal studies don\u0026rsquo;t translate 1:1 with humans.\nTaurine can be cheap depending on the brand. Nutricost brand can provide 2,000mg of taurine a day at $0.04, however Life Extension provides the same 2,000mg dose at $0.34 a day.\nResearch / Sources  Review: Taurine: A “very essential” amino acid [return] Taurine: a conditionally essential amino acid in humans?

	"title": "Crash Dieting",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Crash diets, as a general rule of thumb, are a stupid idea. However, as laid out in my mid-December post On Fitness and Diet - Fighting \\\u0026ldquo;Skinny Fat\\\u0026rdquo;, the weight loss program I set out for myself was exactly that. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this followup post to outline my experience so far, and how I have come to embrace a properly controlled crash diet.\nWhat I Did Crash dieting is all about restricting calories while juggling your micronutrient and macronutrient intake. Most traditional crash diets - like juice cleanses, soup cleanses, or \\\u0026ldquo;grapefruit diets\\\u0026rdquo; - do an amazing job of having an individual cut calories, but do a horrible job at micro/macro nutrient management. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to say, but drinking smoothies for two weeks straight isn\u0026rsquo;t going to make you lose weight - but instead you\u0026rsquo;ll just feel like crap due to malnutrition. Not only that, but as I lay out in my On Fitness and Diet blog post, there is a maximum \u0026ldquo;velocity\u0026rdquo; to fat loss which cannot be broken (~31 calories per pound of fat per day), and eating under that amount will just cause that individual to lose water/muscle.\nAnyway. enough ranting about how awful most of these diets are. Here is a spreadsheet that outlines my results over the past four weeks. The diet piece is on the third tab. I drank 2 bottles of Soylent 2.0 (direct link to nutrition facts here) and one double serving protein shake (see nutrition facts here) to achieve a grand total of 1060 calories per day. That number is not random, but is actually the least amount of calories I can consume before my body turns to muscle for energy.\n####Results of the Crash Quantitatively I have lost around 8lbs of body weight over the last four weeks, which is also accounting for water weight (see below). My projections in my spreadsheet have been off by roughly 2lbs every week, but that could be attributed to me shedding water weight, or the all-liquid diet. The fact that the projections have been off consistently by 2.0-2.5lbs every week seems to indicate they are correct in terms of magnitude and direction, but may have a slight skew upwards. The numbers say I should be close to 15% body fat.\nQualitatively I have lost a lot of fat over the last four weeks. My 30 waist jeans are now loose, despite being snug around November of last year. My love handles are gone, as is the fat on my thighs. The man boobs are almost completely gone. For moving from 19% body fat to 15-16% body fat over the last couple of weeks, I have gotten extremely SKINNY. I did not have this same reaction when moving between 23% and 19%, that is for sure. The last fat holdout is my \u0026ldquo;belly fat\u0026rdquo; right around my belly button, but even that has shrunk. Anecdotal reports on the internet seem to indicate belly fat persists until you get down into the 11%-13% range, which is where I will be soon. I have three more weeks of crash dieting until I\u0026rsquo;m done, and will post accordingly with BodPod results when it\u0026rsquo;s over.\nTip #1 : Manage your micros So this one deserves the top spot, for sure. If you look at the nutritional labels of the food I am consuming, you can see I am nowhere close to coming to 100% of what I need daily for micronutrients. Soylent contains a ton of micronutrients, but the recommended number of bottles per day is five, and I\u0026rsquo;m only doing two. This is an easy problem to solve - on top of my normal dosing of Vitamin D and Magnesium I took a high quality multivitamin in the morning after drinking my protein shake. I could definitely tell when I missed that multivitamin - I would start feeling sluggish/tired about halfway through the day. Over time those deficiencies could cause issues, so best to supplement every day.\nTip #2 : Manage your salt This is an overlooked aspect of most crash diets actually, and causes stupid reports like \u0026ldquo;I lost nine pounds in nine days doing this cleanse, but I put it all back on the next week!\u0026rdquo; The human body is largely comprised of water, and one of the many things regulating that water is sodium intake. While I don\u0026rsquo;t typically link out to anecdotal studies, this one person did find that they can gain or lose up to six pounds of body weight by adjusting their sodium intake. I found the same thing - I lost five pounds in the first week as my diet was only giving me 40% of the RDA for sodium. Since then I have been supplementing salt (drinking a glass of ~1200mg of sodium diluted in warm water) and have seen consistent and expected weight loss numbers. Plus I find I\u0026rsquo;m less hungry! Nothing was weirder than craving pickles, or really anything with high sodium content that first week.\nTip #3 : Manage your hunger You will feel hungry on a crash diet - there is no avoiding this one. Waking up hungry and going to bed hungry are not pleasant feelings, but it can be managed quite safely. I do the classic ECA stack to manage hunger throughout the day, which works wonders. As noted in the Examine article, the combination of Ephedrine, Caffeine, and low-dose Aspirin (ECA) is incredibly well studied to be safe, but should not be abused. The dosing laid out in the Examine article works great, however I have slowly ramped up caffeine intake to ~300-~400mg daily.\nTip #4 : Manage your social life Pick your battles when it comes to your social life as most social events involve some kind of calorie consumption (food, alcohol). I have largely checked out of my social life for six weeks to perform this crash diet (focusing instead on side projects), but have managed to go out about once a week. For me losing over a month of socializing is worth the opportunity to have another month or two weight lifting this year, so it\u0026rsquo;s all about priorities.\n"

	"content": "Note: Bonobos has been contacted about this issue and has been taken care of. All of the codes are dead now anyway :P\nEvery year for the past couple of years the online retailer Bonobos.com has held an \u0026ldquo;Easter Egg Hunt\u0026rdquo; on their website. This is typically a fun event whereby you check various pages on their website for codes used to unlock store credit, discounts, and other goodies. The main prize this year was a $500 voucher off any order, but you had to be the first to find and use the code. I woke up fairly for a Saturday (10AM) to participate in this competition, figuring that I could always use some new Bonobos clothes on the cheap. I noticed that they changed it up this year - instead of plaintext codes, they have a javascript popup that displays an image containing the code. Clever, probably harder to download the entire site and grep your way to victory this year. Below is what you see when you first get to the site:\nInteresting, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the source just for curiosity\u0026rsquo;s sake.\nSo it links directly to an image! After playing around with the URL, I found that directory listing/traversal wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option. Well, what happens when we increment/decrement the image file name?\nAwesome, it looks like they are using sequential filenames for this promotion. After decrementing further, I was able to score all of the coupon codes with ease. Here they are below:\nInstead of abusing this newfound power, I decided to call Bonobos and report the issue directly to them. They answered the phone immediately (amazing customer service), and I reported the issue to the rep, who was able to replicate the problem and report it to someone who could fix it. He said that the $500 code was already taken, but I could use any of the ones that I discovered (all of them). I tried all of them, and settled with the largest one that worked - the $100 off $250+. Not bad! +1 for responsible disclosure and Bonobos customer service! This issue shows how important it is to cross your tees (pun intended) and dot your i\u0026rsquo;s when it comes to security. It\u0026rsquo;s a minor issue, and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not as severe as an XSS or SQLInjection, but it could damage the reputation of the company. Simply randomizing that string of numbers would be enough to make it more secure, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t go that far when setting it up. It may be the fault of Monetate.net, which is where the images are hosted, but there should have been some check along the line before launching the promotion.\n"

	"content": "            The Myth of \u0026ldquo;Gaining Muscle While Losing Fat\u0026rdquo;        I usually blog about technology, trends, and industry news on a less-than-frequent basis, but I\u0026rsquo;m taking a sharp left turn with this blog post to talk about something personal - diet and fitness. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last two years trying to improve and iterate on my physical well-being to some degree of success. I\u0026rsquo;m going to use this post both as a personal reference sheet for past learning, but also to hold myself accountable for the next year of fitness gains. I\u0026rsquo;ll structure the piece below to assume someone is coming in with zero fitness experience, like I did two years ago. If you see anything in here that looks odd, feel free to point it out!\n####Fitness Goals\nBefore I kick this off proper, I\u0026rsquo;d just like to state the obvious about what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to accomplish at a high level. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to 1) improve physical aesthetics 2) gain functional strength/endurance 3) improve mental performance and 4) increase life longevity. That list is ordered in terms of priority, so keep that in mind.\n####Measurement\nThe first step to tackling any problem is to start with accurate data. The problem with most fitness programs, in my experience, is that they are two metric programs. What does this mean? They track two metrics - height and weight - as the end-all, be-all for determining how to create a fitness plan. The problem with this approach is that it does not actually address anything relevant to looking good or being strong. You can have a fat 6\u0026rsquo;0 man weighing in at 160lbs, just like you can have a 5\u0026rsquo;11 bodybuilder weighing in at 220. Not having proper metrics defined up front messed me up when I first started (see below), so hopefully others can learn from my mistakes!\n######A Fitness Metadata Model You should be tracking the following metrics: * Height * Total Weight (daily) * Body Fat Percentage (quarterly) * Lean Mass Percentage (quarterly) * Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) (quarterly) * Daily caloric intake (daily) * Any caloric energy burned through cardio (daily)\n######Data collection Height and weight can be collected from any tape measure and scale, respectively. Nothing new there. However, how does one go about collecting body fat percentage and lean mass percentage? Below are some options: * Calipers - requires a trained professional for accurate reading, still not 100% accurate * Bioelectrical impedance - found in most \\\u0026ldquo;smart scales\\\u0026rdquo; these days. This is wildly inaccurate (~8% margin of error) as per this source and personal experience. * Hydrostatic Weighing - They submerge you in water and use math to figure out bf% based on how much water you displace. Very accurate, costs $40-60, finding a location is difficult * DEXA Scan - You are blasted with xrays, and software figures out which parts of you are fat versus lean based on scatter patterns. Most accurate, costs the most money, and finding a location is difficult. * BodPod - They put you in a pressurized capsule and calculate the amount of air displaced. Similar to the hydrostatic method, but just with air instead of water. Incredibly accurate, costs $40-60, and there is a location in every major city. I use this one, but here is a link to find a location.\n######My Anecdote I\u0026rsquo;d like to start this whole post on the single biggest mistake I made in the last two years: not getting accurate quantitative figures of my overall fitness from the start. This is especially true for someone who is classified as \u0026ldquo;skinny fat\u0026rdquo;, or someone with a high body fat percentage but low overall weight. This very special place of fitness hell is hard to work out of, since it requires losing fat while putting on serious muscle - something that requires a very deliberate plan or an insane workout/diet program. I decided to try and diet my way out of skinny-fat, and thought I did a great job, having cut my weight from 170lbs to 145lbs. However, given what I know now, I cut my body fat percentage from ~30% (obese) to ~20% (overweight), and should have gone lower before \u0026ldquo;bulking\u0026rdquo; to gain back muscle. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the right data at the time, and ultimately made poor decisions just based on a single flat metric - total weight.\n10/30/2015: * Height: 6\u0026rsquo;0 * Total Weight: 151.4lb * Body Fat Percentage: 19.6% (29.6lb fat) * Lean Mass Percentage: 80.4% (121.6lb lean)\n* RMR: 1481 calories\n2/08/2015: * Total Weight: 164.6lb * Body Fat Percentage: 24% (39.5lb fat) * Lean Mass Percentage: 76% (125.1lb lean) * RMR: 1538 calories\n8/24/14: * Total Weight: 178.1lb * Body Fat Percentage: 28.6% (50.9lb fat) * Lean Mass Percentage: 71.4% (127.2lb lean) * RMR: 1582 calories\n####Creating a Plan Ok, so you have data, what do you do now? Create a plan! My plan is to minimize body fat percentage while maximizing lean mass, which should be everyone\u0026rsquo;s high level goal! However, what are some \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; limits for each number? Lean mass has a theoretical genetic maximum number (hence why we don\u0026rsquo;t have 700lb bodybuilders - eventually you hit a genetic cap), so there is no worry there. However, body mass percentage has optimal ranges that are different for men and women. The below chart and visual should give you an idea of what body fat percentage you want to target - between 10-14% is my target. The Myth of \u0026ldquo;Gaining Muscle While Losing Fat\u0026rdquo; Gaining muscle mass while losing fat mass is extremely difficult to do except in a couple oddball scenarios. The whole premise of eating less than what is required for your body to function (causing your body to dip into fat stores) while also building complex proteins is a little crazy - the body and thermodynamics simply don\u0026rsquo;t work that way.\nThat being said, I did say it is extremely difficult and not impossible. There are plenty of folks out there that have gained lean muscle mass while losing fat mass. Lyle McDonald actually has a decent writeup on the subject. I won\u0026rsquo;t copy/paste his arguments, but the TLDR is that it is far more efficient to have one goal in mind. If you have a high body fat percentage - focus on cutting fat mass. If you have a low body fat percentage, then focus on building lean mass. Simple as that.\n######Cutting Weight\nFirst off, if you have zero idea how weight gain/loss happens from a data perspective, I thoroughly recommend reading FourmiLab\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Hackers Diet\u0026rdquo;. The author gives it away for free here, so there is no reason not to read it. It may be a bit old (2005), but the fact that it holds up today is a testament to how fundamental the information presented is.\nRegardless, weight loss literally comes down to simple thermodynamics. What does that mean? Calories in minus calories out = delta fat loss or gain. Calories \\\u0026ldquo;in\\\u0026rdquo; is easy to measure - just track whatever goes into your mouth. Apps like MyFitnessPal make this incredibly easy, so there is no reason to track calories. Calories out is more interesting, since there are two factors here. You know that RMR number you got from the BodPod assessment above? That (multiplied by an activity factor, usually 1.2) gives you your \u0026ldquo;TEE\u0026rdquo;, or total energy expenditure. This is your \u0026ldquo;maintenance\u0026rdquo; calorie count - eating below this will cause you to lose weight, while eating above will cause weight gain. Easy peasy.\nHowever, before we go \u0026ldquo;losing weight\u0026rdquo;, we need to understand exactly what we are trying to lose. The answer is obviously fat - but what does that mean? How does that happen, and how quickly? Well, a pound of fat has roughly 3500 calories worth of energy (this is actually a debated topic in academia - current estimates are between 2800 and 3900 calories, but 3500 is a universal estimate). So applying our formula, it takes a 3500 calorie deficit to lose a pound of fat per period of time. If you are aiming for a pound of fat a week, then a 500 calorie deficit per day will get you there on paper. Again, easy!\nSo what is the \u0026ldquo;limit\u0026rdquo; to this formula? Can you technically eat nothing and have ~-1800 calories a day, which would burn 5lbs of fat a week? Short answer: no. Long answer: adipose tissue (fat) can only be broken down so quickly by the body. This \u0026ldquo;velocity\u0026rdquo; metric is often overlooked by dieters, mostly because it is not well known. A 2004 study found that a pound of fat can release 31 calories/day worth of energy. In my case, I currently have 29.6lbs of fat, which means I can run a 917 calorie deficit (29.6 * 31) before my body turns to lean mass for energy. Typically the body prefers to burn fat over muscle, muscle over organ tissue, and organ tissue ONLY as a last resort (\u0026ldquo;starvation mode\u0026rdquo;). Since my TEE is roughly 1850 calories, and the total amount of fat energy I can derive is 917, I\u0026rsquo;m safe eating as low as 950 calories during a cut. So we have a theoretical max fat loss per week - 1.83lbs/wk (derived from 917*7). The amount of calories to cut needs to be adjusted up (about 50 calories a week) to account for less fat being available to use as fuel, which again drives down the theoretical fat loss per week. TLDR: it gets harder to lose fat the skinnier you get. This Google Spreadsheet is my plan for the first two months of 2016.\n######Gaining Lean Mass\nAccording to the above weight cutting spreadsheet, I should be skinny as hell around the first week of March (6\u0026rsquo;0, 137lb, 11.5%bf). My end goal is to be 160lbs @ under 14%bf, so the direction is clear - I need to put on some serious lean mass.\nAfter a little bit of research, it is clear that there is no clear-cut formula around gaining lean mass. There are tons of anecdotes, \u0026ldquo;bro-science\u0026rdquo;, and supplement profiteering going on. but very little actual research around how much muscle a new weightlifter can gain. A summary of the anecdotes show that new weightlifters experience \u0026ldquo;noob gains\u0026rdquo;, where liftable weight increases by 5lbs per workout on complex/accessory lifts. During this time it is not uncommon for the new weightlifter to gain 10lbs-25lbs of lean mass over the course of a year, which comes out to 1/4lb to 1/2lb of muscle gain per week. Since the anecdotes point in that direction, it looks like my goal to be 160@14% might be attainable over the course of a year.\nPicking (and sticking to) a weightlifting plan is pretty critical to the success of gaining lean mass. The general consensus around picking a weight-lifting plan go back to your overall goals. See below at to what I mean here: * Low repetitions (5x5), high weight = plan built around increasing strength * Medium repetitions (5x8-12), medium weight = aesthetics * High repetitions (5x20), low weight = endurance/cardio training * Given the goals I stated at the beginning of this blog post, I\u0026rsquo;m going with the middle option. The best type of aesthetic plan is called PPL (Push-Pull-Legs), of which I\u0026rsquo;ll be following this one that a Reddit member put together. The focus of the plan revolves around one complex lift per day (Bench Press, Deadlift, and Squat, respectively) with a plethora of accessory lifts mixed in. The plan is to track liftable weight along with body weight on a weekly basis.\nOn the topic of nutrition, a couple things come up here. Just like losing weight, gaining lean mass starts in the kitchen. The goal is to eat 15%-20% over my TDEE, which should come out to around 2100 calories per day. Getting enough protein as part of that 2100 is fairly important, however not as important as originally thought. The study linked there claims that there is no observable difference in muscle synthesis when eating 1.35x your bodyweight (kg) in grams of protein per day than 2.5x+ your bodyweight in grams of protein. Since that is a confusing statement, the authors are pretty much saying if you weight 67kg (around 150lb), then you should eat at least 90g of protein per day. Anything above that has diminishing returns, but that should be your minimum protein target daily. Oh, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter when you consume protein (pre or post workout), its all the same!\nAnd lastly, supplements. A 2003 meta-analysis of most supplements in the fitness space showed that only one supplement actually works - creatine monohydrate. Supplemental creatine taken daily increases lean mass gains significantly according to eighteen studies done on this exact topic - in fact it almost doubles leans gains (see the meta-analysis linked above for references). Outside of consistent workouts, diet, and creatine, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much else to do!\n####Conclusion So after all of that - my weight loss plan starts January 1st. It ends the first week of March around 11.5% bodyfat, whereby a new BodPod assessment will be performed to ensure that I am at that bodyfat percentage. After that it will be 9 solid months of PPL-style workouts! I\u0026rsquo;ll post an update around March, then another again in 12 months with actual data to support the execution of the plan.\n"

	"content": "The big question that comes up every four years always winds up being - how can we best quantify a presidential debate? CNN has tried quantifying public opinion around the debates with it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;undecided voter\u0026rdquo; sentiment, rudimentary Twitter analysis, and polling random joes on the street. The problem with these studies is one simple thing - sample size and error. In a world where 1%-2% more votes means victory or defeat, we cannot have small sample sizes that lead to 4-5% error. Large scale social media analysis, thanks to Radian6, seems to solve this issue, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be breaking down aggregate social data around last night\u0026rsquo;s VP debate in response to the media\u0026rsquo;s horrible metrics.\nNumber of Tweets This metric is a double edged sword for us as researchers.How can we derive any meaning from the aggregate number of tweets about a candidate during the debates? Is it true that there is no such thing as bad press? Regardless, here is the aggregate tweet data from Thursday until Friday, including the spike in tweets about the debate. Our query is simply searching for the names of the candidates, their twitter handles, and common abbreviations of their names.\nAs you can see, Biden clearly led Ryan in the number of people talking about him on Twitter. Let\u0026rsquo;s run a word frequency cloud on each candidate to get a feel for what people were saying about each candidate.\nWord clouds can give you a lot of noise, but a couple interesting words pop out. Paul Ryan generated a lot of hits from the hashtag #factsmatter, which was used when the tweet focused on fact checking the candidate. Over on the Biden word cloud you can see some negative words like \u0026ldquo;rude\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;interrupting\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;laughing\u0026rdquo;. It is interesting to note that the opposing candidate in each word cloud is the second largest in frequency, which indicates that there was a lot of direct comparisons made between the candidates.\nTopic Analysis What were the hot topics during last night\u0026rsquo;s debate? Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look:\nDefense related topics (Iran, military spending, Libya) were at the forefront of the debate last night, and that is reflected in the social data. The interesting data point here is that the abortion topic only came up for a short time at the end of the debate, but takes second place for most discussed issue over jobs/unemployment and tax reform.\nHow did this debate affect the presidential candidates when it comes to the issues? The graph on the left shows the aggregate number of posts about each issue over two weeks (starting the day before the VP debate) as they relate to the presidential candidates. The graph on the right shows the same thing over the same span of time, but also includes last night\u0026rsquo;s debate (as they relate to the presidential candidates, not VPs). This will effectively show us HOW the discourse around the candidates changed as their VPs duked it out last night.\nNotice anything? They are nearly identical. If you look closely abortion and defense got decent sized bumps, but the discourse remained relatively the same. There just wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough volume to affect the proportion of issues talked about over the last two weeks, but it\u0026rsquo;ll be interesting to see what happens if we were to compare this graph to the same graph 1-2 weeks from today, to see if the VP debate had any longer term shifts in issues.\nWho Won?\nThis question has always bothered me. There are a million ways to measure who won the debate, and really, is there a binary yes/no answer to this question? Anyway, CNN introduced two hashtags - #BidenWinning and #RyanWinning - which they encouraged their viewers to tweet throughout the night. Well, the results are in!\nConclusions\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s all the data! Interpret it as you will, but it suggests that Biden had a stronger performance comparative to Ryan.\n"

	"content": "The popular game show *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire* used to fascinate me as a child. The show itself was entertaining, novel for the time, and dramatic (“Is that your final answer?” anyone?). However, one part of the Millionaire always stuck out to me: why was the audience always right? According to James Surowiecki, the best-selling author of \u0026ldquo;The Wisdom of Crowds\u0026rdquo;, the audience on Millionaire was correct 91% of the time. The basis of Surowiecki’s argument is that the decision of a group is always better than the decision of one of its members. Surowiecki postulates that the group needs to meet several requirements - such as being from diverse backgrounds, resistant to groupthink, and have access to the same basic information - in order of them to make the best decisions possible. That’s what made the audience from Millionaire so great – it was a group of diverse people who couldn’t communicate with each other giving their qualified opinions on which answer was correct. So how does this relate to social media, the foreign exchange market, and a potential correlation worth millions?\nArmed with this knowledge, I was given access to a social media-monitoring and engagement platform called Radian6. It allows the user to search, collect, and visualize data from the social web on a grand scale. Radian6 allows companies to track the effectiveness of their social campaigns (“are people actually talking about my brand?”) , along with engage directly with their customers in one convenient platform. I was given access to this amazing platform thanks to a partnership between Clemson University, Dell, and Radian6 – which gave students like myself unlimited access to research anything we wanted. I immediately thought back to an article in Wired in which researchers from Indiana University found a correlation between the general mood on Twitter and the stock market. The general “mood” on Twitter was able to accurately predict the daily movements of the stock market 86.7% of the time, which is an incredible correlation (source). Similarly, researchers from HP Labs identified a correlation between posts on Twitter about movies and their respective box office sales. I figured that this deserved to be looked at a second time, so several of us (myself, Scott Cole, Paul Smith, James Kaplanges, and Brett Smentek) formed a group to analyze this further.\nI learned very quickly that constructing a social query surrounding stocks would not be an easy feat. How would we differentiate the company “Apple” from the fruit? How would we interpret news about AAPL as positive, negative, or neither? Why were people misspelling “back” as “bac” and throwing off our search results for Bank of America’s stock ticket, BAC? This was going to be a nightmare. However, we also discovered that people on Twitter used the notation $BAC or $AAPL to talk about stock tickers. After analyzing how many people used that notation, we decided that weren’t able to effectively watch one stock. We would encounter spikes of traffic surrounding one company – for instance if an earnings report came out, or a large piece of news was released. So, we plugged in all 3000+ securities listed on the NYSE one-by-one into Radian6 and watched intently on which stocks were being talked about the most. We were able to spot a correlation between social traffic on a particular ticker and big market movements, which was exciting. However, the amount of queries that Radian6 had to run for our stock analysis slowed their servers down to the point where it affected other customers. We had our topic profile disabled, but thankfully we were able to keep our access to the platform. Whoops!\nWith our stock project essentially shut down I turned my focus to the foreign exchange market. Since there are only a few currency pairs to examine, it ensured that we could drive in enough social traffic to examine with only a few search keywords. After searching through social media posts about foreign exchange, we discovered several keywords that would yield tons of relevant opinions on whether to buy or short a currency pair at a specific time. We had essentially found the Ask the Audience lifeline for the foreign exchange market. We look for instances where Buy or Sell volume outweigh each other by a certain amount. In this example we would have executed trades in the 8AM and 12PM ranges.\nAfter analyzing some preliminary data from our Radian6 topic profile, we had enough data to construct a rudimentary automated trading algorithm. The initial results of this algorithm were overwhelmingly positive, so we pressed on. Over the course of seven weeks we have come up with a very sophisticated trading algorithm that can respond to a number of market conditions, which has shown to have a very effective in practice trading. Out of 58 trades made by our Radian6 powered social algorithm, only 13 moved in the opposite direction. That is a 77% prediction rate, which may be higher because of inefficiencies within the autotrading algorithm. On average we secured 32 pips per trade, which beat our goal of 20 pips per day by a good percentage.\nWe started with $5,000 in a demo brokerage account leveraged 50:1 and let it trade over the course of seven weeks. As of today, we have $44,000 in the account (784% increase) and are on course to have over one million dollars in the account before the end of June.\nThe X axis represents individual trades, while the Y axis represents dollars in the demo account. We make anywhere between 1-2 trades per day, and this represents 35 days worth of trades. Note that there was a period of neutral/negative growth for about a week. That week was extremely volatile price wise (no discernible upward/downwards trends), and pointed out a flaw in our method. Group decision making may be accurate and effective, but it is far less fast and efficient in comparison to individual decision making. By the time enough posts come through to trigger a trade, the market has already made its short-lived movement and is moving towards a correction. Regardless of this setback, our social media autotrading bot destroyed our expectations and continues to make great trades.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " I\u0026rsquo;m a big advocate of science-backed supplements to optimize mental and physical performance. These articles represent my own distilled research on effectiveness, risk, and other things to consider before supplementing. To see what supplements I am currently taking, definitely check out the \u0026ldquo;My Current Supplements\u0026rdquo; article at the top of this section. Most of the sources are dervived from Examine.com, which is a great resource, but my intent is to distill it down and add my own research + anecdotes.\nWhat is Vitamin D? Vitamin D is recognized as one of 24 \u0026ldquo;essential vitamins\u0026rdquo; along with vitamins A, C, K, and B12, just to name a few. Fun fact - it is actually classified as a steroid that regulates the expression of close to 1000 genes in the body (1\u0026frasl;24 of the genome), which makes it fairly important.\nVitamin D Sources  UVB Radiation (The Sun) - The body manufactures Vitamin D naturally when the skin makes contact with UV-B radiation from the sun. However, the amount of Vitamin D produced is marginal, and the risks of skin cancer from being exposed to UV-B radiation from natural sunlight offset any health gains from increased Vitamin D production1 Diet - Milk (124IU per cup) and fatty fish (500IU per salmon filet). Given the optimal levels of Vitamin D require 2000IU+ per day, the amount of Vitamin D needed from diet sources makes this a non-starter. Supplementation  A report by the US Nutritional Health and Examination Survey in 20092 found that 75% of Americans are Vitamin D deficient. The survey naturally blames staying indoors, the use of sunscreen, and changing of American diets to the sharp increase in Vitamin D deficient adults. Plus we are discovering that biological optimal ranges of Vitamin D occur outside \u0026ldquo;historical normal\u0026rdquo; values, which means the medical guidance is showing most people are now deficient.\nBenefits of Supplementation Benefits are listed from best supported to least supported\n Decrease in Overall Mortality - this may be a bit of correlation vs. causation issue, but the research does back an overall lower risk of death for non-deficient patients345 General Bone Health - Optimal Vitamin D levels, especially combined with Vitamin K supplementation, leads to stronger bones across all age ranges.6 Lower Blood Pressure - Linked study found an overall reduction of 5mmHg blood pressure when patients increased blood serum D levels.57 Higher Testosterone (in men) - A single study found raising Vitamin D serum levels also increased testosterone in men who were deficient.8 Higher estrogen (in women) - Single study found raising Vitamin D serum levels also increased estrogen in women who were deficient.9 Lower Cancer Risk - There is a strong correlation between Vitamin D deficiency and your risk of developing cancer. The following cancers have research backing this claim: breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. One study even claims that supplementation of 2000IU/day saw a 50% reduction of breast cancer incidence.1011 Increased Mental Performance - There is a linear relationship between Vitamin D levels and verbal fluency up to and exceeding 100ng/ml.12 Decreases Incidences of Depression - Low levels of serum Vitamin D (\u0026lt;20ng/ml) is highly correlated with incidences of depression. Fixing Vitamin D deficiencies has shown to be a solid first-line step in battling depression.13  Downsides and Toxicity to Vitamin D Supplementation  There is a risk of toxicity with taking too much Vitamin D. The reason behind this is around Vitamin D being a fat-soluable vitamin which can build up in the body over time. There are reported cases of over-supplementation leading to hospitalization. See the next section about how to not screw up the dosing for Vitamin D - thankfully most supplements are well within \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; dosing ranges.  Now the fun part - toxicity! The National Institute of Health states that a consistent Vitamin D blood serum level of 200ng/ml is potentially toxic. The only way to get blood serum levels that high is to take 10,000-40,000IU supplements daily for close to three months. So yeah, super low to no toxicity, unless you are really trying. And fun fact - you cannot get Vitamin D toxicity naturally - food doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough to get to those levels, and the skin regulates Vitamin D production automatically.14\nDosages and Timing For Vitamin D The first step to figuring out if you need to supplement Vitamin D is to get a routine blood test to check for active Vitamin D levels. Your PCP can order this, or you can use a service like WellnessFX to self-service the blood test at a premium. Vitamin D production and absorption is impacted by several genetic markers, so there is no clear cut advice for everyone. When in doubt, the FDA recommends 1000IU-2000IU daily is safe for most of the population. Remember, you may need more or less given 1) how much Vitamin D is in your blood already and 2) your genetic markers for Vitamin D.\nOnce you have your blood test data back, you can compare your results against the table below. This table is roughly accurate with the most recent research on the topic of optimal Vitamin D blood serum levels.15\nIf your blood test comes back wildly deficient, then the highest safe dosage of Vitamin D is 10,000IU daily for three months. It is recommended to get your blood tested again and revise the dosing if necessary.\nTiming wise, Vitamin D is best taken in the morning with a fatty breakfast. Taking Vitamin D at night can disrupt circadian rhythms16 and lead to poor sleep quality. If you don\u0026rsquo;t eat breakfast, then Vitamin D can be taken with Fish Oil to increase absorption. They also make Vitamin D capsules that have olive oil / other fats in them, which also can make a difference.\nGwern (an independent biohacker) also validated this timing evidence through his own experiment with taking Vitamin D at night.17\nVitamin D and Genetics Your genetics play a large role in Vitamin D synthesis, usage, and storage. SNPedia keeps an up-to-date list of what genetic markers are known to positively or negatively impact Vitamin D levels - SNPedia Link. If you have done 23andme or Ancestry.com genetic testing, then you can export that data in Promethease to check for these SNPs directly.\nAnecdotes Since I\u0026rsquo;ve started tracking my own Vitamin D levels, I can say that I\u0026rsquo;ve never been clinically low in Vitamin D. I have always supplemented with 2000IU Vitamin D since college, so that has contributed to my relatively stable 60ng/ml blood levels. I have experimented with going up to 5000-10000IU daily with no success in impacting my blood levels, but that may be due to genetic and other health factors. I want to try and get closer to 75ng/ml overall, since that is the current guideline for long term bone and heart health.\nCost Conclusion and Recommendations You should take 2000IU or more Vitamin D daily. There is virtually no downside and it costs about $0.06 a day to do it.\nRecommended Brand: Nutrigold 2000IU. This brand has a great score on LabDoor in regards to quality. Link to LabDoor Vitamin D Page\nVitamin D is extremely cheap to supplement. High quality 5000IU capsules cost about $0.06 per day on average, which is a cheap price to pay for a staple nutritional supplement.\nResearch / Sources  SkinCancer.org: Make D, not Sunlight, a Priority [return] Implications of a new definition of vitamin D deficiency in a multiracial us adolescent population: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III.
